Notes

Make sure to set up a Spotify Developer account and obtain API credentials for authentication. This project serves as a frontend application and requires a backend server to handle authentication and API requests securely. Some features require Spotify premium membership to work. Features such as Play, Pause, Next, and Previous require premium access and will throw a 403 error if you do not have a subscription.
